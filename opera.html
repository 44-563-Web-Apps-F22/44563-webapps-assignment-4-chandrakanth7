            SCENE.—Courtyard of Ko-Ko's Palace in Titipu.  Japanese nobles
                 discovered standing and sitting in attitudes suggested by
                 native drawings.</h6>
        <p>Enter Nanki-Poo in great excitement.  He carries a native guitar
            on his back and a bundle of ballads in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            CHORUS.   We shouldn't be surprised, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            PISH.  And what may be your business with Yum-Yum?
        </p>
        <p>
            POOH.  But I don't stop at that.  I go and dine with
            middle-class people on reasonable terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            NANK. and POOH.  And the brass will crash, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            ALL.                And the brass will crash, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pish-Tush.
                       RECIT.—NANKI-POO and POOH-BAH.
        </p>
        <p>
            YUM.  Still, that don't make it right.  To flirt is capital.
        </p>
        <h5>NAN</h5>
        <p>
            A wandering minstrel I—
            A thing of shreds and patches,
            Of ballads, songs and snatches,
            And dreamy lullaby!
        </p>
        <p>
            About to embrace her.
        </p>
        <h5>YUM</h5>
        <P>With aspect stern
            And gloomy stride,
            We come to learn
            How you decide.

            Don't hesitate
            Your choice to name,
            A dreadful fate
            You'll suffer all the same.
        </P>
        <p>
            Taking it from him reverentially
        </p>
        <h5>POO</h5>
        <p>
            I think you ought to recollect
                 You cannot show too much respect
                 Towards the highly titled few;
                 But nobody does, and why should you?
        </p>
