            If you want to know who we are,<br>
            We are gentlemen of Japan:<br>
            On many a vase and jar—<br>
            On many a screen and fan,<br>
            We figure in lively paint:<br>
            Our attitude's queer and quaint—<br>
            You're wrong if you think it ain't, oh!

            And if you call for a song of the sea,<br>
            We'll heave the capstan round,<br>
            With a yeo heave ho, for the wind is free,<br>
            Her anchor's a-trip and her helm's a-lee,<br>
            Hurrah for the homeward bound!

        <p class = "speech">I'll tell you.  A year ago I was a member of the<br>
            Titipu town band.  It was my duty to take the cap round for<br>
            contributions.  While discharging this delicate office, I saw<br>
            Yum-Yum.  We loved each other at once, but she was betrothed to<br>
            her guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, and I saw that my suit was<br>
            hopeless.  Overwhelmed with despair, I quitted the town.

            Even if you only succeeded in cutting it half off,<br>

            The fact appears to be as you've recited:<br>

            Now tell us all the news, because you go about<br>
            everywhere, and we've been at school, but, thank goodness, that's<br>
            all over now, and we've come home for good, and we're not going<br>
            back any more!

            Besides—a wandering minstrel, who plays a wind<br>
            instrument outside tea-houses, is hardly a fitting husband for<br>
            the ward of a Lord High Executioner.<br>
            The son of the Mikado!  But why is your Highness<br>
            disguised?  And what has your Highness done?  And will your<br>
            Highness promise never to do it again?

            Two little maids remain, and they—<br>
            Won't have to wait very long, they say—<br>
            Three little maids from school!<br>
            Three little maids who, all unwary,<br>
            Come from a ladies' seminary,<br>
            Freed from its genius tutelary—

            With aspect stern<br>

            Don't hesitate<br>
            Your choice to name,<br>
            A dreadful fate<br>

            And merry dance,<br>
            As in a month you've got to die,<br>
            If Ko-Ko tells us true,<br>

            But as one month you have to live<br>
            As fellow-citizen,<br>
            This toast with three times three we'll give—<br>
            "Long life to you—till then!"
