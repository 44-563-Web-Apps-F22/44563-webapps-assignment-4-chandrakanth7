            Katisha rushes furiously up stage, clearing the crowd away right<br>
            and left, finishing on steps at the back of stage.

            One little maid is a bride,<br>
            Two little maids in attendance come—<br>
            Three little maids is the total sum.<br>
            Three little maids from school!<br>
            From three little maids take one away.<br>
            Two little maids remain, and they—<br>
            Won't have to wait very long, they say—<br>
            Three little maids from school!<br>
            Three little maids who, all unwary,<br>
            Come from a ladies' seminary,<br>
            Freed from its genius tutelary—
        </p>
        <p class = "song2">
            With aspect stern<br>
            And gloomy stride,<br>
            We come to learn<br>
            How you decide.<br>
            Don't hesitate<br>
            Your choice to name,<br>
            A dreadful fate<br>
            You'll suffer all the same.
        </p>
        <p class = "song3">
            Then let the throng<br>
            Our joy advance,<br>
            With laughing song<br>
            And merry dance,<br>
            As in a month you've got to die,<br>
            If Ko-Ko tells us true,<br>
            'Twere empty compliment to cry<br>
            "Long life to Nanki-Poo!"<br>
            But as one month you have to live<br>
            As fellow-citizen,<br>
            This toast with three times three we'll give—<br>
            "Long life to you—till then!"
